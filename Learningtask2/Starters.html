        <h3>Method</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Cook the chorizo in a non-stick frying pan over high heat,
                stirring occasionally, for 3 minutes or until crisp. Transfer to
                a plate lined with paper towel.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Melt the butter in a medium saucepan over medium-high heat until foaming.
                Stir in the flour for 1 minute. Remove from heat. Stir in one-third of the milk.
                Gradually stir in remaining milk until the mixture thickens.
                Stir over medium-high heat for a further 2 minutes or until very thick.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Stir in the chorizo and parsley.
                Season with pepper. Transfer to a shallow container.
                Set aside to cool slightly. 
                Cover and place in the fridge for 4 hours or overnight to set.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Place the extra flour, egg and breadcrumbs in separate bowls.
                Use floured hands to roll tablespoonfuls of chorizo mixture into 8cm-long croquettes. 
                Roll each croquette in flour and shake off excess. Dip in egg, then in breadcrumbs to coat. 
                Place on a baking tray lined with baking paper.
            </li>
            <li>
                Add oil to a large saucepan to come 5cm up the side of the pan.
                Heat to 170C over medium-high heat (when oil is ready a cube of bread will turn golden brown in 20 seconds).
                 Cook croquettes, in 3 batches, turning occasionally, for 1-2 minutes or until golden and heated through.
                  Transfer to a tray lined with paper towel.
